# WOJACKRYPT 2.0

Encode your text with the wojackrypt 2.0 cipher. Wojackrypt 2.0 is a new rewritten version of wojacrypt. It can now encrypt ANY character which it previously couldn't. The encryption system is different to the original wojacrypt, therefore they aren't compatible with each other.
Wojackrypt 2.0 still cannot encrypt raw bytes. In that case it is recommended for them to be represented as a base64 string and encrypted as such.
